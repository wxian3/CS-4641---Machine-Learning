# README FILE
# Machine Learning
# Assignment 1
#
# After completing the assignment, fill in this README file.  It asks you to duplicate
# your answers to several questions.  Be certain that your answers in this README file
# (which may be used for auto-grading) match the answers in your PDF writeup.
#
# This README file is formatted in YAML to allow it to be machine readable.  Please
# be very careful with how you edit it, being careful to following the formatting.
# Make certain not to change any text in all UPPERCASE.  After editing, you can make 
# certain that your README file follows proper YAML syntax by running it through an
# online YAML checker, such as http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
# 
# The most frequent error is multi-line strings, such as "SOURCESCONSULTED" and 
# "FEEDBACK_ERRORS".  Make certain that the previous line ends with a | followed by a 
# newline.  Then, make certain that the subsequent lines are indented one level in 
# (4 spaces).  This sounds complex, but just follow the existing format of this file.
# If you run into any problems that you can't fix easily in listing your sources or 
# providing feedback on the assignment, just include your multi-line string answers to
# these parts as comments.  Everything else (all simple one-word or numeric answers) must
# be properly formatted YAML.

# Answer to Implementation Exercise 2.5:  Closed form of linear regression
#######################################################################################

# Copy and paste your one-line matrix equation for computing the closed form solution
# to linear regression (e.g., Line 171 of test_linreg_univariate.py or Line 51 of 
# test_linreg_multivariate.py)
LINREGIMPLEMENTATION_CLOSEDFORM: theta_closed_form = inv(X.transpose() * X) * X.transpose() * y
